# Participating in the Workshop

Participants will also be asked to spend
the week before ASSETS thinking about situations, news articles, and encounters in
their daily life that pertain to the intersection of accessibility and
technology in a wide variety of circumstances. We will also encourage participants to brainstorm about which areas of
accessibility research are lacking attention to further guide our
selection of topics in the structured discussions. 


We will also have an active
asynchronous conversation server (Slack or Discord, still TBD) where we will ask
participants to upload one photo, audio snippet, or text comment per day for
the week before ASSETS (including and overlapping their travel to
ASSETS if they are attending in person). 


# Schedule and Location

- A West Coast workshop will be held on Tuesday the 17th of October from 1pm-3pm at the University of Washington.
- An East Coast workshop will be held on Sunday the 21st of October from 10am-12pm with an option to join the organizers for lunch afterwards. We are hoping to hold this at NYU but still need to confirm.

These events will be structured as follows:
- 15 minutes: Introductions
- 10 minutes: Presentation highlighting themes in workshop submissions and more general topics for 3rd wave research
- 40 minutes: Small group discussions focused around different shared topics of interest. We will encourage participants to first
write answers to three discussion questions in a shared Google document and then talk about them as a group:
(1) What are some important research questions at the intersection of technology, disability, and [topic]?
(2) How can we best center the perspectives of people with disabilities who live at this intersection? For example, are there
community-based organizations we could collaborate with?
(3) What are the risks and opportunities of engaging with this topic?
- 10 minutes: Break
- 30 minutes: Group share out
- 15 minutes: Discussion of next steps
