# Submission Timeline and Process

Submissions have a very loose structure and allow previously published
formal and informal writing or videos. 

Please send your submissions to jmankoff@acm.org before the end of your day on September 28th, 2023.

Please tell us about any accessibility needs at the same time. 

We will distribute these
submissions to participants, and post them (with permission) on this website.

# Default and Possible Accommodations

We plan to support hybrid participation in the workshop, as well as asynchronous participation (see our [Schedule]({{site.url}}/a11yfutures/schedule/) for more details).

Other accessibility defaults
- We will project autocaptions in person and enable them online
- We will request funding from ASSETS for CART/ASL participation if needed. We do not yet have confirmation about whether this will be supported. Please reach out to us when you submit if you need this.
- We have tried to schedule events at timezone-inclusive times
- We would like to hear from you about any other needs. Contact jmankoff@acm.org
