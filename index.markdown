Please join us in envisioning the future of accessibility work. As
technology has extended into new realms, so has our field.
Accessibility research is tackling a wider variety of topic areas
driven by the observation that people with disabilities are present in
(and often over- or under- represented in) all of the same spaces as
people without disabilities. 

Examples of recent work in these domains
include spaces where people with disabilities are under represented
(such as in higher education, or under studied, such as research into
the experiences of immigrants with disabilities; and research that
looks at intersectional identities such as race and disability.
However many relevant domains remain to be explored including domains
where people with disabilities are over-represented (such as in
unhoused populations and in the carceral system) or are at higher risk
of harm (such as during disaster response and sustainability). It is
also imperative that we engage in positive aspects of disability culture
such as mutual aid; disabled joy; sports; hobbies; and family life. 

In todayâ€™s world, technology is similarly
present in all of those spaces; and this raises new types of access
questions. This workshop aims to explore and develop goals for a
future in which our field broadens its concept of relevant topics in
the important work of studying and developing technology that supports
and empowers people with disabilities.

# Workshop Goals

The goals of this workshop are to develop this agenda and launch a
speaker series to explore these topics over the course of the next
year. We plan to rotate the time of these talks to accommodate
different time zones. We also plan to work together to write a
position paper that can inspire, and empower, our community to
encourage, engage in, and support the work of extending our field into
new and under studied domains. Participation criteria will be based on
submission of a relevant writing sample (we allow new writing, previously
published formal and informal writing or videos). Participants can
select whether accepted papers should be made public or not.

# Workshop time and location


- A hybrid East Coast workshop will be held on Sunday the 21st of October from 10am-12pm with an option to join the organizers for lunch afterwards (for in person participants only). Location is still TBD. 
- A hybrid West Coast workshop will be held on Tuesday the 17th of October from 1pm-3pm at the University of Washington.
